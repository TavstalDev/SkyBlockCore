## Note about this repository
> ⚠️ Since I have quit MesterMC, due to burnout I am probably not going to update this plugin anymore. ⚠️

## Description
SkyBlockCore is the core plugin used for MesterMC's SkyBlock server introducing extra features to enhance the SkyBlock experience.

## Features
- Afk Pool: Rewards players for being AFK in a designated area.
- Playtime Rewards: Grants rewards based on the amount of time players spend on the server.
- Leveling System: A basic leveling system that tracks player levels.
- Hourly, Daily, and Weekly Rewards: Provides players with rewards at regular intervals.
- - Please note that these rewards are only implemented on just database level and was partially used via DeluxeMenus. If I have motivation in the future I might add native support for these rewards.
- Jobs Menu for Jobs Reborn: Integrates with the Jobs Reborn plugin to provide a jobs menu for players.
- - Currently, unimplemented due to lack of motivation.
- Factory System: Allows players to make items via GUIs.
- - Currently, unimplemented due to lack of motivation.
